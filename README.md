# zomato_webScapping
This project extracts restaurant data from Zomato, including location, names, ratings, discounts, best-selling items, prices, and delivery times. The data is scraped, cleaned, and structured for further analysis.

Using exploratory data analysis (EDA), trends in restaurant performance, pricing, and delivery patterns are identified. Visualizations provide insights into how different factors impact delivery times and restaurant popularity.

A linear regression model is implemented to predict delivery time based on key features. This project showcases skills in web scraping, data preprocessing, EDA, and machine learning, offering valuable insights into the food delivery industry.
